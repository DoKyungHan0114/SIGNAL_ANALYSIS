# SIGNAL_ANALYSIS

In conjunction with the Fraser Island Tourism board, our team has been commissioned to conduct preliminary analysis on the construction of a new radio station for use in emergency communications on Fraser Island. Due to the size of the island, it was decided to make use of the FM transmission protocol, to broadcast signals responding to sudden weather events, or natural disasters.
